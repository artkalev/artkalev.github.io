# Kalev MÃ¶lder

I am a Software developer & 3D Generalist with a decade of experience with VFX 3D workflows, VR, AR, WebGL, Unreal Engine, Unity, Blender, Houdini, C++, C#, Python and Lua to name a few. I consider myself a jack of all trades and a master of some.

This site serves the purpose of a blog where I can shout into the void and a Portfolio to showcase some of the things I have done.
