I recently had the pleasure to complete an interesting project involving WebGL and live green screen keying.

As always with such things, the concept seemed simple at first glance. The idea was that the gin bottle would have a flat green label printed on it to act as a greenscreen and when viewed through a phone camera it would be keyed out to reveal a video playing "on" the label.

## Prototype

I started creating a rough proof of concept prototype uing plain Javascript and WebGL to see how well I could key out a greenscreen cylinder viewed through a webcam.

Usually the lighting conditions are granually controlled in a studio setting to make sure that the light on the greenscreen is as uniform as possible to make sure that the green colors are easy to isolate in post production.

I did not have that luxury. Anybody would be able to use their phone to look at the green label of the bottle in any light condition.

## Simple Hue Keying

One way to isolate a certain color in an image is to convert the color RGB information into HSV( hue, saturation,  )
