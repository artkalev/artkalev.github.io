title: "WebGL2 Basics: Texture"
---

This is a tutorial article on the basics of using textures while drawing with WebGL2. It builds upon the [last tutorial]({% post_url 2025-01-09-webgl-basics %}) where we were drawing a triangle with vertex colors.

## UV Coordinates

Before we get to creating and loading textures, we must be aquinted with texture coordinates (UVs).

You probably have an intuition about UVs if you have used a 3D modeling software and worked with texturing in that context.
