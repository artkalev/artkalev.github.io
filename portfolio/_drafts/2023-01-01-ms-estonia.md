title: MS Estonia Asset & Rendering
---

It was my task to prepare the MS Estonia ship asset and render the shot of it leaving port.

# Asset

I started by taking an existing MS Estonia model and improved it with new UVs materials and textures. The look of the side walls was the most important aspect in the context of the shot so that's where most of my focus was.

# Shot

After having prepared the asset, it was just a matter of building the LOP network in Houdini to add a slight animation and render the shot.

It was fun to setup the lighting because it was such a distinct low evening sun light in the footage. We had many tests and discussions about where exactly the shadows would fall as it altered the aesthetic of the shot significantly.
