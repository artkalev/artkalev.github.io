It was my responsibility to create an asset of a old forest house which is featured in [Oxen](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27416866/).

It had to be quite detailed as it would be featured from many angles in the show.

# Details

I modeled and textured the house using a few photos from the set as reference. There was a front section built physically at the set.

To add more dirt and grime at the rendering and final composition step, I created a masking shader that masks the corners of the geometry. This works by using the Ambient Occlusion data mixed with various 3D noises to isolate the "corner" areas of the geometry in an interesting way. Corner areas are the places where most of the debris and dust collects over time.

This enabled the final scene renderers and compositors to have more artistic freedom while developing the look of the dirt that would be on such surfaces.
