I had the opportunity to be involved with the development of a VR multiplayer shooter game "SkyFront VR" from the prototyping phase to the release phase of the project.

## My Role

I was already experienced Unity software developer and 3D Generalist at that point, so my role was split between general unity script development, shader design / implementation and pipeline management with the 3D artist team.

VR hardware and software state of the art was really at the beginning phase when we started developing this game (HTC Vive 1 era). This meant that graphics optimisation was extremely important to ensure good VR experience.

The 3D artists were mostly from VFX related backgrounds which meant a lot of tutoring on my part to ensure optimal game performance of the assets. I also built middleware scripts in Blender to merge certain object meshes  together to reduce certain draw calls later in Unity. There is always room for more optimisations but in the end I was satisfied with what we achieved in regards to the balance of performance and visual fidelity.

Designing and writing shader code has always been a passion of mine, so creating different effects like: force field shield, shockwave distortion, holographic red dot etc, was really enjoyable.

The development process lasted about 2 years. It was intense but interesting period.
