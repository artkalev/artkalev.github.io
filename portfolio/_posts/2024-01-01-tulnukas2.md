# Car Asset Preparation

![Car Asset Image](/assets/portfolio/tulnukas2/tulnukas_car_0.png)

We got the assignment to create the VFX for the [Alien 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31956993/) an Estonian comedy movie. My task was to prepare the asset of a customized car which was featured in many shots.

# Details

We got a base model of the Nissan Leaf to build upon. I added new geometry, materials and textures to make the car look like physical car that was used in the shooting. The asset did not have to be extremely detailed as the VFX shots featured it from quite far away.
