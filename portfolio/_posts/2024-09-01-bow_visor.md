My responsibility was to create the asset for MS Estonia Bow Visor using photos and a lidar scan as reference. It was quite challenging to model and texture this model because it was in a damaged rusted state, which means there is a combination of hard surfaces and organic deformed surfaces and edges.

I usually prefer to create very complex shaders to get various effects like rusting done mostly procedurally. Using shaders enables Me to setup a non-destructive system for texturing mainly using vertex color data to indicate areas. This speeds up the iteration on the look of the surfaces and in the end I can just bake out the PBR textures from the shader to use the asset in other renderers and 3D software.

## Animation & Rendering

My task was also to setup and render some of the shots featuring this bow visor using Houdini SOP and Karma renderer.
